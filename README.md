# TwitterComplain

TwitterComplain is a Python script that measures your internet speed and automatically tweets a complaint if the speed is lower than the promised internet speed in your internet provider contract. This project aims to hold internet service providers accountable for providing the agreed-upon internet speed to their customers.

Introduction

Internet service providers often advertise certain internet speeds in their contracts but fail to deliver them consistently. TwitterComplain automates the process of measuring your internet speed and tweeting a complaint on your behalf to draw attention to the issue. By publicly sharing your dissatisfaction on social media, this script aims to raise awareness about the quality of internet services provided by various ISPs.

Note: Be cautious while using this script to avoid violating Twitter's usage policies. Excessive tweeting or automated content may result in account suspension.
